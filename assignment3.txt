Solution:1) Primitive is the most fundamental data type usable in the Programming language.
A primitive data type is a data type that is built into a programming language.

solution:2)Mostly Declaration statement written outside the function.

Solution:3)Size of float data type is 4 bytes.

Solution:4) Value of uninitialised variable is garbage value.

Solution:5)float take 4 bytes size and double take 8 bytes size. float has 7 decimal precision
and double has 15 decimal precision.

Solution:6)ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange

Solution:7)A function is executed within a stack frame, whereas a keyword statement isn't necessarily

Solution:8) Modifiers are keywords in C which changes the meaning of basic data type in c. It specifies the amount of memory space to be allocated for a variable. Modifiers are prefixed with basic data types to modify the memory allocated for a variable.

There are two types of type modifiers:

    Size modifiers – short, long
    Sign modifiers – signed, unsigned

They can be further sub-divided into these four data type modifiers :

    long / long long
    short
    signed
    unsigned

Solution:9)Yes , we can assign chaarcter constant in int variable .e.g int a='a'

Solution:10)No eveyry block of code is not function for examle if  me made block of for loop then 
it is only a block not a function.
